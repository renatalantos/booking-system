## Introduction

The product Restaurant Booking System is a fictitious restaurant website. 
Beside being able to view pages like the home page, menu and the contact page, users are also able to create an account, sign in and avail of the table booking feature, which unregistered users don't have access to. Through the booking, users can access all their previous bookings, edit and delete them. Site user administrators have access to all bookings and all create, edit and delete functionalities.
The site has been designed to be fully responsive on desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile devices.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories 

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the business.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to sign up for a user account to access restricted content.
        4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to create a table booking, view booking details, and learn what changes I can make on created bookings.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to sign into my user account and sign out at the end of the session.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to create a table booking, view booking my current and previous booking details, edit them or delete them.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to sign out of my account at the end of the session to keep my account safe.
        4. As a Returning visitor I want to leave feedback on the restaurant services.

## Layout
-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours in the website theme for header, background, footer and text labels are brown, yellow, and beige.
    -   #### Typography
        -   I used a standard Bootstrap theme with all the components and styling. The css stylesheet was using a set of Google Fonts, like BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI with fallback to Roboto, Helvetica Neue with fallback to Arial, sans-serif, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery was chosen to go with the website's colour and content theme. I'm using dining and restaurant interior images with deep-toned, soothing colours and attractive graphics. For the edit, delete and logout page I'm using images with graphics that signal what will happen if user edits, deletes or signs out.

*   ### Wireframes
    -   #### Discrepancy with original ideas
        -   I originally intended to create my own HTML pages and CSS styling, however, I decided to use a standard Bootstrap theme instead, which saved me a huge amount of time. I simply followed the theme layout, customized text labels for various forms, so the original wireframes were not used at all. As the theme is fully responsive, I didn't create mobile device wireframes after deciding to use Bootstrap. By using a Boostrap theme, my theme is more unified, too. I also created a menu page for the site, which wasn't in my original plans.

## Features

-   The application is responsive on all device sizes, thanks to the Boostrap theme. In mobile view there is a collapsible menu icon. All images, text labels, forms get appropriately resized. There is an exception, however: when bookings are displayed in the database table in the view_booking.html, on mobile phone screens in portrait mode there is not enough room for all columns to be shown. However, Bootstrap adds a slide bar so that user can slide the page content from left to right.

In mobile phone landscape mode all columns show beside one another, however, the nav header and footer don't reach from one end of the page to the other.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        1. At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2. To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
        3. There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
